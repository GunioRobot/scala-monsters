This is a recreation of an old PC game, I believe was named Monsters.

The game map consists of a grid with randomly placed boxes, monsters and players. 
The boxes can be pushed, and several can be pushed at once, but they cannot be dragged. Hence, if a box ends up by a wall, it probably cannot be used again.
If a player or monster is in the way of your player pushing the boxes, he will act as a wall and stop the progression of the boxes.
However, if there is a wall behind the monster/player, it will be squished.
Game ends when all opponents/monsters are squished.

The game is envisioned to be hub'n'spoke, where the server manages the games legal state, and the clients are concerned with providing the GUI for displaying the game board, moving pieces, or providing headless monsters.
